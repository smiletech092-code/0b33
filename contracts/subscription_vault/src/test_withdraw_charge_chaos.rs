//! Chaos test: order-independence of `withdraw_merchant_funds` and
//! `charge_subscription` over the shared merchant accounting path.
//!
//! # What this proves
//!
//! `charge_subscription` credits a merchant (`credit_merchant_balance_for_token`)
//! and `withdraw_merchant_funds` debits one (`withdraw_merchant_funds_for_token`).
//! Both mutate the same three pieces of state:
//!
//! * `DataKey::MerchantBalance(merchant, token)` — the authoritative balance
//! * `DataKey::MerchantEarnings(merchant, token)` — the derived `TokenEarnings` ledger
//! * `DataKey::TotalAccounted(token)` — the global accounting anchor
//!
//! Soroban executes one invocation at a time, so there is no true data race
//! here. What *can* desync is the **derived** ledger: if a credit or debit
//! updates `MerchantBalance` and `TokenEarnings` inconsistently, the two views
//! drift apart, and the drift depends on the interleaving. That is the
//! race-adjacent bug class this test targets.
//!
//! The core property is a commutativity claim. For a fixed multiset of
//! operations — `c` successful charges of `amount` each, and a set of
//! withdrawals summing to `w` — the final state must not depend on the order
//! in which they were applied:
//!
//! ```text
//! MerchantBalance          == c * amount - w
//! accruals.interval        == c * amount        (monotonic; withdrawals never touch it)
//! withdrawals              == w                 (monotonic; charges never touch it)
//! refunds                  == 0                 (no refund was ever issued)
//! computed_balance         == MerchantBalance   (derived view agrees with stored)
//! ```
//!
//! where `computed_balance = accruals - withdrawals - refunds`, matching
//! `merchant::get_reconciliation_snapshot`.
//!
//! Note the *expected commutativity* qualifier in the property: charges and
//! withdrawals commute only up to feasibility. A withdrawal of `w` is rejected
//! when the current balance is below `w`, so a permutation that front-loads
//! withdrawals legitimately performs fewer of them than one that front-loads
//! charges. The harness therefore records which operations actually succeeded
//! and asserts the invariant against that realised multiset, rather than
//! demanding that every permutation execute identically. Asserting the latter
//! would be wrong, not strict.
//!
//! # Trace generation and shrinking
//!
//! `proptest` generates a permutation of an operation multiset via a
//! Fisher-Yates shuffle driven by a generated index vector, so the shuffle
//! itself shrinks. On failure the harness prints the shrunk permutation as a
//! replayable `OpKind` sequence together with the per-step state transitions,
//! so a maintainer can paste the trace into a `#[test]` without re-running
//! proptest.
//!
//! # Edge cases covered by the deterministic tests below
//!
//! * `withdraw_immediately_after_charge` — no idle interval between credit and debit
//! * `batch_charge_then_drain` — many charges accumulate, then one full-balance drain
//! * `withdraw_at_zero_balance` — withdrawal against an untouched//drained ledger
//!
//! # ⚠ STATUS: UNVERIFIED — THIS TEST HAS NEVER BEEN EXECUTED
//!
//! `cargo test` cannot build this crate at the commit this file was written
//! against (`c2473ed`). `cargo check --lib` reports 169 pre-existing errors in
//! `lib.rs`, `subscription.rs`, `merchant.rs`, `types.rs`, `queries.rs`,
//! `admin.rs`, `charge_core.rs` and `dispute.rs`, caused by ~485 lines of
//! definitions going missing from `types.rs` between `ab3b2f7` and `1312f1e`
//! (missing `DataKey` variants, `Error` variants, `CancellationEscrow`,
//! `normalize_amount`, and the `Subscription::auto_renew` field). Two
//! duplicate-definition errors compound it: the `use crate::types::{...}` block
//! at `merchant.rs:24` names six items twice, and `mod test_subscription_transfer;`
//! is declared twice in `lib.rs` (3510 and 3513).
//!
//! None of that is caused by this file, and none of it can be fixed from here.
//! Consequently the assertions below are written from a reading of the source,
//! not from observed behaviour, and the signatures they call may need
//! adjustment once the crate builds. Treat every `assert_eq!` as a hypothesis.
//!
//! # Two known-broken invariants this test deliberately does NOT assert green
//!
//! **1. `refunds` is double-counted on withdrawal.**
//! `merchant.rs:901-913` increments *both* `earnings.refunds` *and*
//! `earnings.withdrawals` by `amount` on every withdrawal, while
//! `MerchantBalance` is decremented once. `merchant_refund` (`merchant.rs:988`)
//! touches only `refunds`, confirming that bucket is not meant to absorb
//! withdrawals. So `computed_balance = accruals - withdrawals - refunds`
//! understates the true balance by exactly the withdrawn amount, and
//! `get_reconciliation_snapshot`'s `checked_sub(..).unwrap_or(0)` clamps the
//! negative result to `0` so the desync never surfaces as an error.
//!
//! `prop_withdraw_charge_order_independent` asserts `refunds == 0` and
//! `computed_balance == stored_balance`, both of which should FAIL on the
//! current source. That is intentional: this is the bug the test exists to
//! catch. See `xfail_refunds_double_count_on_withdraw` below for a minimal
//! deterministic reproduction.
//!
//! **2. `TotalAccounted` cannot be asserted at all.**
//! `src/accounting.rs` is not compiled into the crate — there is no
//! `mod accounting;` declaration anywhere. `lib.rs:327` defines an inline
//! `pub mod accounting` whose three functions ignore their arguments and whose
//! `get_total_accounted` unconditionally returns `0`. Every
//! `crate::accounting::add_total_accounted` / `sub_total_accounted` call in the
//! charge and withdraw paths is therefore a no-op against the real
//! `DataKey::TotalAccounted` storage.
//!
//! Asserting `get_total_accounted() == expected` would compare `0` to `0` for
//! the empty case and pass while proving nothing. The `TotalAccounted` half of
//! the invariant is marked `#[ignore]` in
//! `ignored_total_accounted_tracks_net_flow` with instructions for re-enabling
//! it once `accounting.rs` is actually wired in.

/// The `TotalAccounted` half of the invariant the task asks for.
///
/// Currently unassertable: `src/accounting.rs` is not compiled into the crate
/// (no `mod accounting;` exists), and the inline `pub mod accounting` at
/// `lib.rs:327` stubs all three functions — `add_total_accounted` and
/// `sub_total_accounted` ignore their arguments, and `get_total_accounted`
/// always returns `0`. Every accounting call in the charge and withdraw paths
/// is therefore a no-op against `DataKey::TotalAccounted`.
///
/// Writing `assert_eq!(get_total_accounted(..), 0)` here would pass while
/// proving nothing, which is worse than an explicit gap. To re-enable:
///
/// 1. Add `mod accounting;` to `lib.rs` and delete the inline stub module.
/// 2. Drop the `#[ignore]` and the `return` below.
///
/// The assertion body is written out so it is ready to run.
