//! ABI boundary validators.
//!
//! Every public entrypoint that accepts user-supplied `String` or `Address`
//! arguments **must** call the appropriate helper at the top of its body,
//! before any auth checks or storage reads.  Centralising the checks here
//! keeps the guard logic reviewable and consistent across the whole contract.
//!
//! # Why these validators?
//!
//! Soroban accepts any XDR-encodable value from a transaction; it does **not**
//! silently reject an empty `Bytes`-backed `String` or an all-zero `Address`.
//! Allowing those values to reach storage would:
//! - Store degenerate metadata keys that can never be deleted (empty string
//!   keys collide with each other or are un-displayable off-chain).
//! - Accept the zero `Address` as a treasury or token, effectively burning
//!   funds sent there.
//! - Allow an attacker to supply the contract's own address as a party,
//!   creating confused-deputy or re-entrancy windows.
//!
//! # Security assumptions
//!
//! - These helpers are **not** a substitute for auth (`require_auth`); call
//!   auth checks first, then input validation.
//! - `reject_contract_self` compares against `env.current_contract_address()`,
//!   which is always correct even if the contract is called via cross-contract.
