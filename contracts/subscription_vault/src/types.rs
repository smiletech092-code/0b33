///
/// A batch is charged sequentially inside a single transaction. Each id costs
/// a bounded but non-trivial number of instructions (subscription read, fee
/// maths, token transfer, storage writes, event emission). Because the
/// per-transaction instruction budget is a *network* limit, not a contract
/// limit, a batch that is too large does not fail with a contract error — it
/// fails with a generic `exceeded budget` execution error, which is
/// indistinguishable from a genuine out-of-gas problem and cannot be
/// programmatically retried by the caller.
///
/// Capping the batch length in the contract turns that ambiguous network-level
/// failure into a deterministic, catchable contract error *before* any state
/// is touched, so the caller can split the batch and retry safely.
///
/// Callers should treat this as a hard ceiling and plan batches well below it
