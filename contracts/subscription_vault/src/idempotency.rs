//! Shared ring-buffer idempotency key helpers.
//!
//! Three entrypoints use idempotency keys: `charge_subscription`,
//! `deposit_funds`, and `charge_one_off`.  Each domain is scoped with a
//! unique domain constant so that reusing the same raw 32-byte key across
//! different entrypoints does **not** produce a replay collision.
//!
//! Storage key: `DataKey::IdemKey(subscription_id)` stores `IdemRingBuffer`.
//!
//! ## Replay-protection window
//!
//! Each entry stores the hash **and** the ledger timestamp at insertion.
//! `check_key` ignores entries older than `IDEM_TTL_SECS`; they are treated
//! as if they were never inserted.  This bounds the replay-protection window
//! to a fixed time duration rather than a fixed count of operations, closing
//! the ring-cycling attack described in issue #13.
//!
//! `push_key` still evicts the oldest slot by cursor position when the buffer
//! is full, so storage usage stays bounded at `IDEM_HISTORY` entries regardless
//! of charge frequency.
