//! Multi-token withdrawal isolation test (#590).
//!
//! `merchant.rs` stores per-merchant balances keyed by `(merchant, token)`
//! (see `merchant_balance_key` / `get_merchant_balance_by_token` /
//! `set_merchant_balance`), and several shared helpers
//! (`credit_merchant_balance_for_token`, `withdraw_merchant_funds_for_token`,
//! `dispute::do_open_dispute`) mutate that keyed storage on behalf of *all*
//! tokens a merchant is accepted for. A regression in any of these shared
//! helpers (e.g. an accidental fallback to the contract's default token via
//! `get_merchant_balance` instead of `get_merchant_balance_by_token`) could
//! silently debit or credit the wrong token's balance.
//!
//! This suite funds a single merchant across three independent tokens (A, B,
//! C), withdraws token A, and asserts:
//!
//! 1. Token A's merchant balance drops by exactly the withdrawn amount.
//! 2. Token B's and token C's merchant balances are byte-for-byte unchanged.
//! 3. The vault contract's on-chain token balance for B and C is unchanged,
//!    while A's decreases by exactly the withdrawn amount (conservation).
//! 4. The behavior holds under three edge cases required by the issue:
//!    - withdrawing an amount equal to the full token A balance,
//!    - withdrawing token A while token B has funds locked in an open
//!      dispute escrow, and
//!    - repeated withdrawals of token A.
//!
//! # Security notes
//!
//! - `withdraw_merchant_funds_for_token` reads/writes storage exclusively
//!   through `merchant_balance_key(merchant, token)`, so in the current
//!   implementation there is no code path by which withdrawing token A can
//!   touch token B/C's balance key. This suite exists to pin that guarantee
//!   as a regression test, since the balance/earnings/accounting helpers are
//!   shared across tokens and a future edit could easily reintroduce a
//!   token-agnostic shortcut (e.g. calling `get_merchant_balance`, which
//!   hard-codes the contract's *default* token, from a code path that should
//!   be token-parameterized).
//! - Dispute escrow (`dispute::do_open_dispute`) debits the merchant's
//!   balance for the *disputed subscription's token only*, before any
//!   interaction; this suite confirms that debit is not visible to, or
//!   perturbed by, withdrawals of a different token.
//! - Separately, while reviewing `merchant.rs` for this test we observed that
//!   `withdraw_merchant_funds_for_token` increments `earnings.refunds` (in
//!   addition to `earnings.withdrawals`) on every withdrawal, and calls
//!   `set_merchant_balance` twice in a row. Neither affects cross-token
//!   isolation (both operate on the single token being withdrawn), so they
//!   are out of scope for this test, but are worth a follow-up ticket.
