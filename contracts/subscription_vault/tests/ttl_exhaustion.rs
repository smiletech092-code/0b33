//! Persistent-storage TTL exhaustion and recovery tests for `DataKey::Sub(id)`.
//!
//! # What this covers
//!
//! Subscription records live in **persistent** storage (`env.storage().persistent()`)
//! keyed by [`DataKey::Sub`]. Persistent entries carry a *time-to-live* (TTL): they
//! stay accessible only while `live_until_ledger >= current_ledger`. Every read
//! (`get_subscription`) and write (`write_subscription`) bumps the entry's TTL via
//! `extend_ttl(SUB_TTL_THRESHOLD, SUB_TTL_EXTEND_TO)` — see
//! `contracts/subscription_vault/src/subscription.rs` and `docs/storage_layout.md`.
//!
//! These tests force the entry past its TTL by advancing the ledger sequence and pin
//! down three properties:
//!
//! 1. **Boundary** — the record is readable at *exactly* its last live ledger
//!    (`created_seq + SUB_TTL_EXTEND_TO`).
//! 2. **Exhaustion** — one ledger later the entry is expired and accessing it raises a
//!    Soroban **host error**, never a silent success returning stale data.
//! 3. **Recovery / second cycle** — touching the record at the last opportunity
//!    re-extends its TTL, so it survives past the original window with its data intact,
//!    and a *second* full TTL cycle eventually expires it again.
//!
//! # Observed host behavior (soroban-sdk 22 / soroban-env-host 22.1.3)
//!
//! Reading an **expired persistent entry** does NOT return `None` (which would surface
//! as a clean `Error::NotFound`). The host aborts with `Error(Storage, InternalError)`,
//! which the test harness surfaces as a Rust panic. `try_get_subscription` does **not**
//! convert this into a recoverable `Err(...)` either — the host error propagates as a
//! panic. The correct, faithful assertion is therefore `catch_unwind` / `#[should_panic]`,
//! not `expect_err`. This is the *safe* outcome: an expired record can never be read as
//! live data; on-chain it would require a `RestoreFootprint` operation before access.
//!
//! # Why the contract instance TTL is extended in these tests
//!
//! Invoking any contract entry-point requires the contract **instance** entry to be live.
//! The instance is created with only the default minimum TTL and is not re-extended on
//! every call, so naively advancing the ledger ~`SUB_TTL_EXTEND_TO` ledgers would expire
//! the instance long before the `Sub` entry — and `get_subscription` would then fail for
//! the wrong reason. [`keep_instance_alive`] bumps only the instance TTL so that the
//! **sole** entry whose expiry governs the outcome under test is `DataKey::Sub(id)`.
