## What’s in this repo

### Contract: `subscription_vault`

A single Soroban contract that implements a **prepaid subscription vault** for recurring USDC billing:

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Subscriber** | User who holds a subscription; funds are held in the contract (vault) for that subscription. |
| **Merchant** | Recipient of recurring payments; can withdraw accumulated USDC. |
| **Subscription** | Agreement between subscriber and merchant: amount, billing interval, status (active/paused/cancelled), and prepaid balance. |

**Main capabilities (current / planned):**

| Method | Signature | Auth | Docs |
|--------|-----------|------|------|
| `version` | `version(env: Env) -> u32` | — | — |
| `init` | `init(env: Env, token: Address, admin: Address, min_topup: i128)` | — | [lifecycle](docs/subscription_lifecycle.md) |
| `create_subscription` | `create_subscription(env: Env, subscriber: Address, merchant: Address, amount: i128, interval_seconds: u64, expiration: Option<u64>, usage_enabled: bool) -> u32` | subscriber | [lifecycle](docs/subscription_lifecycle.md) |
| `deposit_funds` | `deposit_funds(env: Env, subscription_id: u32, subscriber: Address, amount: i128)` | subscriber | [lifecycle](docs/subscription_lifecycle.md) |
| `charge_subscription` | `charge_subscription(env: Env, subscription_id: u32)` | admin | [lifecycle](docs/subscription_lifecycle.md) |
| `batch_charge` | `batch_charge(env: Env, subscription_ids: Vec<u32>) -> BatchChargeResult` | admin | [lifecycle](docs/subscription_lifecycle.md) |
| `cancel_subscription` | `cancel_subscription(env: Env, subscription_id: u32, authorizer: Address)` | subscriber or merchant | [lifecycle](docs/subscription_lifecycle.md) |
| `pause_subscription` | `pause_subscription(env: Env, subscription_id: u32, authorizer: Address)` | subscriber or merchant | [lifecycle](docs/subscription_lifecycle.md) |
| `resume_subscription` | `resume_subscription(env: Env, subscription_id: u32, authorizer: Address)` | subscriber or merchant | [lifecycle](docs/subscription_lifecycle.md) |
| `withdraw_merchant_funds` | `withdraw_merchant_funds(env: Env, merchant: Address, amount: i128)` | merchant | [lifecycle](docs/subscription_lifecycle.md) |
| `get_subscription` | `get_subscription(env: Env, subscription_id: u32) -> Subscription` | — | — |

**Types:**

**`Subscription`**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `subscriber` | `Address` | Owner of the subscription; must auth create and deposit. |
| `merchant` | `Address` | Recipient of charges. |
| `amount` | `i128` | Charge per interval (in token base units). |
| `interval_seconds` | `u64` | Minimum time between charges. |
| `last_payment_timestamp` | `u64` | Ledger timestamp of last successful charge. |
| `status` | `SubscriptionStatus` | Lifecycle state; see state machine below. |
| `prepaid_balance` | `i128` | Current balance; increased by deposit, decreased by charge. |
| `expiration` | `Option<u64>` | Optional ledger timestamp after which the subscription is treated as expired. `None` means no expiry. |
| `usage_enabled` | `bool` | Usage-billing flag; reserved for future use. |

**`SubscriptionStatus`** — `Active`, `Paused`, `Cancelled`, `InsufficientBalance`, `GracePeriod`.

See [subscription_lifecycle.md](docs/subscription_lifecycle.md) for the full state machine and transition rules.

**`Error`** (selected variants — see [docs/errors.md](docs/errors.md) for the canonical table with numeric codes):

| Variant | Category | When |
|---------|----------|------|
| `Unauthorized` | Auth | Required signer or admin mismatch. |
| `NotFound` | Not found | Subscription id or resource is missing. |
| `NotInitialized` | Not found | Contract has not been initialized. |
| `InvalidAmount` | Invalid args | Amount is zero or negative. |
| `InvalidStatusTransition` | State | Lifecycle transition not permitted from current status. |
| `NotActive` | State | Operation requires Active subscription. |
| `SubscriptionExpired` | State | Subscription has passed its `expiration` timestamp. |
| `IntervalNotElapsed` | State | Charge attempted before interval has elapsed. |
| `InsufficientBalance` | Accounting | Vault balance is insufficient. |
| `BelowMinimumTopup` | Accounting | Deposit is below the configured `min_topup` threshold. |

> **Implementation status:** `contracts/subscription_vault/src/lib.rs` currently exposes only the `version()` stub while the full implementation is rewritten on a future branch. The method table and type definitions above reflect the intended API as methods land. See the inline doc-comment in `lib.rs` for context.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** (latest stable, e.g. 1.75+):  
  https://rustup.rs  
  `rustup default stable`
- **Soroban CLI**:  
  https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/soroban-cli/install  
  Used to build WASM and run tests/deploy.
- **Stellar / Soroban basics**:  
  https://developers.stellar.org/docs  
  Optional but helpful for contributing.

---

## Local setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/0b33.git
cd 0b33
```

(Replace `YOUR_ORG` with the actual org or user.)

### 2. Install Rust and Soroban CLI

- Install Rust: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` then `rustup default stable`.
- Install Soroban CLI per the [official install guide](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/soroban-cli/install).

### 3. Verify the environment

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
soroban --version
```

### 4. Build and test (no network required)

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

From the repo root, this builds the workspace and runs the contract unit tests (including `subscription_vault` tests in `contracts/subscription_vault/src/test.rs`).

### 5. (Optional) Build contract WASM

```bash
soroban contract build
```

This produces the WASM under `target/` for deployment to Stellar (e.g. testnet/mainnet via Soroban CLI or your CI/CD).

### 6. Install Git hooks

Set up the repository pre-commit hook to enforce code formatting and linting
on staged files before every commit:

```bash
./scripts/install_git_hooks.sh
```

The installer is **idempotent** — safe to run repeatedly. It:

1. Sets the executable bit on all scripts under `.githooks/`.
2. Runs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (no global config changes).
3. Smoke-tests the hook to confirm it exits 0.
After installation, every `git commit` automatically runs:

| Check | Command | Scope |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Formatting | `cargo fmt --check` | staged `.rs` files only |
| Linting | `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` | full workspace |

**Bypass options:**

```bash
git commit --no-verify              # standard Git flag, no logging
SKIP_PRE_COMMIT=1 git commit        # env-var bypass, prints a warning to stderr
```

**Verify the installation is correct without modifying anything:**

```bash
./scripts/install_git_hooks.sh --check
```

> Note: `cargo clippy` always runs against the full workspace (not only staged files)
> because clippy operates at crate granularity. A change in one file can surface
> a lint in a test that imports it, so the broader scope is intentional.

## Build, test, and deploy

| Task | Command |
|------|--------|
| Build workspace | `cargo build` |
| Run tests | `cargo test` |
| Build contract WASM | `soroban contract build` |
| Install Git hooks | `./scripts/install_git_hooks.sh` |
| Verify hook installation | `./scripts/install_git_hooks.sh --check` |
| One-command local deploy | `./scripts/deploy_local.sh` |
| Run with Soroban CLI (e.g. testnet) | See [Stellar docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/soroban-cli) for `soroban contract deploy` and `invoke`. |

### One-command local deployment

[`scripts/deploy_local.sh`](scripts/deploy_local.sh) automates the full workflow:
building the contract, starting a local Soroban network (via Docker
`stellar/quickstart`), deploying, initializing, and running a smoke test.

```bash
./scripts/deploy_local.sh              # full flow
./scripts/deploy_local.sh --skip-build # reuse existing WASM
./scripts/deploy_local.sh --skip-smoke # deploy + init only
./scripts/deploy_local.sh --help       # full option reference
```

**Prerequisites:** `rust`, `soroban`/`stellar` CLI, `docker`, and `curl` (all checked at startup).

The script creates three test identities (`admin`, `subscriber`, `merchant`),
wraps the native Stellar asset as a test token, and validates the deployment
by creating, funding, and charging a subscription.

### Error table generation

[`scripts/generate_error_table.py`](scripts/generate_error_table.py) is a code-generation utility that produces the canonical error-code cross-reference table by:

1. Parsing `contracts/subscription_vault/src/types.rs` to extract error variants and numeric codes.
2. Grepping all `.rs` source files to identify which contract entrypoints emit each error.
3. Splicing the generated table into the "## Entrypoint Cross-Reference" section of [`docs/errors.md`](docs/errors.md).

**Usage:**

```bash
python scripts/generate_error_table.py       # Generate and update docs/errors.md in-place
python scripts/generate_error_table.py --check # Check mode: fail if docs/errors.md would change (used by CI)
```

The generator is deterministic; when run without changes to the error enum or emitting code, it produces no output diff. The generated table is committed to the repository as the single source of truth for error codes and recommended client retry handling.

## Contributing (open source)

We welcome contributions from the community. Here’s how to get started and how we work.

### Before you start

- Read this README and the [Stellar / Soroban docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs).
- Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/0b33/issues) for “good first issue” or “help wanted” labels.
- If you want to change behavior or add a feature, open an issue first so we can align on design.

### Development workflow

1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub and clone your fork.
2. **Create a branch** from `main` (or default branch):  
   `git checkout -b feature/your-feature` or `fix/your-fix`.
3. **Set up locally** as in [Local setup](#local-setup). Run `./scripts/install_git_hooks.sh` to enable pre-commit checks (`cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy`). Run `cargo test` and `cargo build` to ensure everything passes. (Note: pre-commit hooks can be bypassed when necessary via `git commit --no-verify`).
4. **Make changes** in small, logical commits. Keep messages clear (e.g. “Add admin check to charge_subscription”, “Fix subscription id overflow”).
5. **Run tests and build** before pushing:  
   `cargo test && cargo build` and, if you touch contract interface, `soroban contract build`.
6. **Push** to your fork and open a **Pull Request** against the upstream `main` (or default branch).

### Pull request guidelines

- **Scope**: One logical change per PR when possible (easier review and atomic history).
- **Tests**: New behavior should be covered by unit tests in the contract crate; existing tests must stay green.
- **Docs**: If you add or change a public function or type, update the README or inline docs as needed.
- **Description**: Use the PR description to explain the “why” and how to verify (e.g. steps or test commands).

### Code and design expectations

- **Rust**: Follow common Rust style (`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`). No `unwrap()` in contract logic without a clear justification; prefer `Result` and explicit errors.
- **Soroban**: Use `Env` for storage and auth; keep contract functions narrow and well-documented.
- **Security**: Any change that touches auth, token transfers, or admin rights will get extra review. When in doubt, open an issue first.

### Getting help

- **Questions**: Open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/0b33/discussions) or an issue with the “question” label.
- **Bugs**: Open an issue with steps to reproduce, environment (Rust/Soroban versions), and logs if relevant.
- **Ideas**: Use Discussions or an issue with “enhancement” so we can track and discuss.

### Code of conduct

We expect all contributors and maintainers to be respectful and inclusive. By participating, you agree to uphold a constructive and professional environment. Specific CoC details (if any) will be linked in the repo (e.g. `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` or in the GitHub community guidelines).
