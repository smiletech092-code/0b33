# Auto-Renewal Disable Flag and Renewal Window

Implements issue [#562](https://github.com/Stellabill/0b33/issues/562).

This document describes the `auto_renew` flag on `Subscription`, the renewal
window mechanism, and the `set_auto_renew` entrypoint.

---

## Overview

By default every subscription is created with `auto_renew = true`, meaning the
billing engine will continue charging it at each interval boundary indefinitely.

A subscriber or merchant may call `set_auto_renew(false)` to opt out. Once
disabled, billing halts at the **next interval boundary** — the current period
completes normally but no further automatic charges are taken. Prepaid balance
and all history are preserved in place.

A **renewal window** of one full `interval_seconds` after the flag was first
disabled allows the subscriber or merchant to re-enable auto-renewal without
having to cancel and recreate the subscription. If the window elapses without
re-enabling, the subscription can no longer be reactivated via
`set_auto_renew(true)` — it must be cancelled and a new one created.

---

## Data Model

Two fields are added to `Subscription`:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auto_renew` | `bool` | `true` | When `false`, the billing engine skips charges once the interval elapses. |
| `auto_renew_disabled_at` | `Option<u64>` | `None` | Ledger timestamp of the **first** `set_auto_renew(false)` call. Used to calculate the renewal window deadline. Reset to `None` when auto-renewal is re-enabled. |

### Renewal window boundary

```
window_end = auto_renew_disabled_at + interval_seconds
```

Re-enabling is permitted while `now < window_end`. At or after `window_end`
the call returns `Error::RenewalWindowClosed` (12001).

---

## Entrypoint: `set_auto_renew`

```
set_auto_renew(env: Env, subscription_id: u32, authorizer: Address, enabled: bool)
  -> Result<(), Error>
```

### Authorization

`authorizer` must be the subscription's `subscriber` **or** `merchant`.
Any other caller receives `Error::Forbidden` (1002).

### Guards

| Condition | Error returned |
|---|---|
| Subscription does not exist | `NotFound` (2001) |
| Caller is neither subscriber nor merchant | `Forbidden` (1002) |
| Subscription is `Cancelled` | `InvalidStatusTransition` (4001) |
| Subscription has passed its `expires_at` | `SubscriptionExpired` (4003) |
| `enabled = true` but `auto_renew` is already `false` and window has closed | `RenewalWindowClosed` (12001) |

### Idempotency

- Calling `set_auto_renew(false)` when already `false` **preserves the
  original `auto_renew_disabled_at` timestamp**. The window continues to count
  from the first disable, not the most recent call.
- Calling `set_auto_renew(true)` when already `true` is a no-op (succeeds,
  no state change).

### Event emitted

`AutoRenewToggledEvent` with topic `("auto_renew_toggled", subscription_id)`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `subscription_id` | `u32` | Affected subscription. |
| `subscriber` | `Address` | Subscription subscriber. |
| `merchant` | `Address` | Subscription merchant. |
| `enabled` | `bool` | New value of `auto_renew`. |
| `authorizer` | `Address` | Caller who made the change. |
| `timestamp` | `u64` | Ledger timestamp at time of call. |
| `schema_version` | `u32` | Event schema version. |

## Merchant Blocklist Behavior During Renewal

When auto-renewal would trigger a charge (i.e., `auto_renew = true` and the
interval has elapsed), the contract checks the **merchant's blocklist status** at
renewal time. If the merchant is blocklisted:

- The renewal charge **fails** with `SubscriberBlocklisted` or
  `MerchantBlocklisted` error (depending on which party is blocklisted).
- The subscription transitions to `GracePeriod` or `InsufficientBalance`
  depending on grace period configuration.
- The subscriber is notified via `SubscriptionChargeFailedEvent`.

**Security implication:** A merchant cannot use auto-renewal to accept payments
if they have been subsequently blocklisted. This prevents collusion where a
merchant accepts a subscription, then is blocklisted, and attempts to charge
via scheduled renewal. The contract enforces compliance at charge time, not at
subscription creation time.

**Example scenario:**
1. Subscriber creates auto-renewing subscription with merchant on Day 1
   (merchant is in good standing).
2. On Day 30, the interval elapses and renewal is scheduled.
3. Between Day 30 and the charge execution, the merchant is added to the
   blocklist due to compliance violation.
4. When the charge executes on Day 30, it checks the blocklist and fails with
   `MerchantBlocklisted`.

---

## Billing Engine Integration

In `charge_core.rs`, the charge flow includes multiple guards:

1. **Merchant paused/vacation checks** — block if merchant is paused or on vacation
2. **Blocklist checks** — block if subscriber, merchant, or split payees are blocklisted
3. **Expiration checks** — block if subscription has expired
4. **Auto-renewal gate** — silently skip the charge if `auto_renew = false` and
   the interval has elapsed:

```
if !sub.auto_renew && now >= next_allowed_charge_time {
    return Ok(ChargeExecutionResult::Skipped);
}
```

- The charge returns `Skipped` (not an error) so that `batch_charge` can
  continue past non-renewing subscriptions without aborting the batch.
- `IntervalNotElapsed` still fires normally if the interval has not yet elapsed,
  regardless of `auto_renew`.

## State Machine Interaction

`auto_renew` is orthogonal to `SubscriptionStatus`. A subscription may be
`Paused` and have `auto_renew = false` simultaneously. Toggling `auto_renew` is
permitted in all non-terminal, non-expired states:

| Status | Can toggle `auto_renew`? |
|---|---|
| `Active` | ✅ Yes |
| `Paused` | ✅ Yes |
| `GracePeriod` | ✅ Yes |
| `InsufficientBalance` | ✅ Yes |
| `Cancelled` | ❌ No — `InvalidStatusTransition` |
| Expired (`now >= expires_at`) | ❌ No — `SubscriptionExpired` |

---

## Storage Migration

Subscriptions loaded from pre-562 snapshots (via `restore_subscriptions`) are
assigned `auto_renew = true` and `auto_renew_disabled_at = None`, which matches
the creation default and preserves existing billing behaviour transparently.

---

## Error Code

| Code | Variant | When |
|---|---|---|
| `12001` | `RenewalWindowClosed` | Re-enabling auto-renewal after the one-interval window has elapsed. |

---

## Test Coverage

`contracts/subscription_vault/src/test_auto_renew.rs` covers 20 scenarios:

| # | Scenario |
|---|---|
| 1 | Default `auto_renew = true` on creation |
| 2 | Subscriber can disable |
| 3 | Merchant can disable |
| 4 | Third party receives `Forbidden` |
| 5 | Charge skipped when disabled and interval elapsed |
| 6 | Charge proceeds normally when enabled |
| 7 | Re-enable within window succeeds |
| 8 | Re-enable after window closed → `RenewalWindowClosed` |
| 9 | Toggle mid-interval (interval guard still fires first) |
| 10 | Toggle then cancel |
| 11 | Renewal after long dormancy → `RenewalWindowClosed` |
| 12 | Double disable preserves original timestamp |
| 13 | Double enable is a no-op |
| 14 | Cancelled subscription rejects toggle |
| 15 | Expired subscription rejects toggle |
| 16 | Non-existent subscription → `NotFound` |
| 17 | `AutoRenewToggledEvent` emitted on disable |
| 18 | `AutoRenewToggledEvent` emitted on re-enable |
| 19 | Batch charge skips non-renewing subscription cleanly |
| 20 | Paused subscription can toggle `auto_renew` |
