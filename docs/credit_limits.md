## Global subscriber credit limits

Subscribers can hold multiple subscriptions in the vault, potentially across many plans and
merchants. To prevent overextension, the vault supports per-subscriber credit limits that
bound aggregate exposure across subscriptions for a given settlement token.

### Data model

Credit limits are configured per `(subscriber, token)` pair:

- `limit` – maximum allowed exposure in token base units (e.g. 1 USDC = 1_000_000 for 6 decimals).
- `limit = 0` – no limit is enforced for that subscriber/token.

Exposure is computed as:

- `sum(prepaid_balance)` for all subscriptions owned by the subscriber using the token, plus
- `sum(amount)` for subscriptions in the `Active` state (the next-interval liability).

This provides a conservative bound on how much value is either already locked or expected to be
charged in the near term.

### Configuration entrypoints

- `set_subscriber_credit_limit(admin, subscriber, token, limit)`  
  Sets or updates the credit limit for a `subscriber` and settlement `token`. Only the contract
  admin may call this. Passing `limit = 0` clears any effective cap (no limit).

- `get_subscriber_credit_limit(subscriber, token) -> i128`  
  Returns the configured limit, or `0` when none is set.

### Authorization model for limit changes

**Only the contract admin can set or increase a credit limit.** There is no self-service path.

| Caller | Can decrease limit? | Can increase limit? | Can set limit = 0? |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Admin (`DataKey::Admin`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Subscriber (self) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Operator | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Merchant | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Any other caller | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

The implementation in `do_set_subscriber_credit_limit` calls `require_admin_auth(env, &admin)` as its first statement, before any state access. The `admin` parameter is the caller-supplied address; `require_admin_auth` checks it against the stored admin and calls `admin.require_auth()`, so the transaction must carry a valid signature from the current admin. Passing any other address (including the subscriber's own address) returns `Error::Unauthorized`.

**Design rationale:** Allowing subscribers to self-increase their own limits would defeat the purpose of the limit as a risk control. Credit limits exist to protect the protocol and merchants from overextended subscribers; the decision to raise a limit is a trust judgement that belongs exclusively to the admin.

**Lowering a limit** below current exposure is permitted and takes effect immediately. It does not cancel existing subscriptions or claw back prepaid balances — it only blocks future exposure-increasing operations (new subscriptions and deposits) until exposure drops below the new limit.

**Integrator note:** If your frontend needs to request a limit increase on behalf of a subscriber, it must go through an off-chain admin approval flow. The contract provides no on-chain request/approval mechanism for subscriber-initiated limit increases.

### Enforcement points

Credit limits are enforced before new liabilities are introduced:

- **Subscription creation**
  - `create_subscription`
  - `create_subscription_with_token`
  - `create_subscription_from_plan`
  For each of these, the vault checks that `current_exposure + amount <= limit`. If the
  limit would be exceeded, the operation returns `Error::CreditLimitExceeded` and no
  state changes occur.

- **Top-ups**
  - `deposit_funds`
  Deposits increase exposure by the deposit amount. The contract rejects deposits that would
  cause `current_exposure + deposit_amount` to exceed the configured limit.

Existing subscriptions continue to function (charges, cancellations, withdrawals) even when the
limit is reached; only new subscriptions and additional prepaid exposure are blocked.

### View helpers

- `get_subscriber_exposure(subscriber, token) -> i128`  
  Returns the current aggregate exposure used for limit checks. This is suitable for dashboards
  and pre-flight checks in frontends.

### UX and risk policy guidance

- **Choosing limits**
  - For conservative risk, set limits close to the expected total recurring liability across
    all plans (e.g. 1–3 billing intervals worth of charges).
  - For high-trust subscribers, either use a large limit or `0` (no limit).

- **Frontend behavior**
  - Before attempting subscription creation or deposit, frontends can fetch both
    `get_subscriber_credit_limit` and `get_subscriber_exposure` to give users clear guidance
    on how much additional exposure is allowed.
  - When `Error::CreditLimitExceeded` is returned, surface the limit and current exposure to
    explain why the operation failed and what adjustments are needed (e.g. lower amount, cancel
    other subscriptions, or raise the limit).

### Invariants and testing

Exposure is summed with `safe_math::safe_add` (checked addition), so a malicious merchant
cannot wrap the `i128` exposure counter: a sum that would exceed `i128::MAX` returns
`Error::Overflow` instead of silently overflowing.

The following invariants are locked by
[`tests/credit_limit_invariant.rs`](../contracts/subscription_vault/tests/credit_limit_invariant.rs):

1. **No-overflow summation** — `get_subscriber_exposure` equals the sum of prepaid balances
   plus active-subscription amounts, and returns `Error::Overflow` rather than a wrapped value
   at the `i128` boundary.
2. **No over-extension** — an exposure-increasing operation is rejected with
   `Error::CreditLimitExceeded` exactly when it would push exposure above a configured non-zero
   limit; after any accepted increase, `exposure <= limit`.
3. **No claw-back** — lowering a limit below current exposure succeeds and never mutates
   existing exposure; it only blocks *future* increases.
4. **Per-token isolation** — exposure and limits for one settlement token are independent of
   subscriptions denominated in another token.

The headline test drives a randomized 500-step sequence of create / cancel / set-limit
operations against an independently-tracked model. Sequences are deterministic in a `u64` seed;
seeds are pinned under
[`tests/fixtures/credit_limit/`](../contracts/subscription_vault/tests/fixtures/credit_limit/)
so any discovered failure is replayed as a permanent regression guard.
