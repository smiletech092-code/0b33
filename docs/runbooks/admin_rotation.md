# Mainnet Admin Rotation Playbook

> **Version:** 1.0  
> **Scope:** Production two-step admin rotation for the Stellabill Subscription Vault contract on Stellar mainnet.  
> **Last Updated:** 2026-07-30  
> **Status:** Authoritative — all planned admin transfers MUST use this flow.

---

## 1. Overview

This runbook governs the **two-step admin rotation** (`propose_admin` → `claim_admin_role`) for the Subscription Vault contract deployed on Stellar mainnet. The two-step flow replaces the older single-step `rotate_admin` for all planned transfers, providing a **7-day safety window** during which the proposal can be cancelled if the wrong address was targeted or the claimant key is compromised.

### Why Two-Step?

| Risk | Single-Step | Two-Step |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Wrong address entered | Irreversible — funds locked | Cancellable during 7-day window |
| Compromised claimant key | N/A (instant) | Attacker cannot claim unless they control the *proposed* address |
| Fat-finger / copy-paste error | Permanent | Detectable and reversible |
| Front-running | Possible | Claimant must match exact proposed address |

## 2. Pre-Rotation Checklist

Complete **every item** before invoking `propose_admin`. No exceptions.

### 2.1 Identity Verification

- [ ] **Confirm current admin address**: Run `get_admin` and verify against the expected address.
- [ ] **Verify current admin key custody**: Confirm you have signing access (private key, hardware wallet, or multisig threshold).
- [ ] **Validate new admin address**: 
  - [ ] Address is NOT the contract address (`InvalidNewAdmin` guard).
  - [ ] Address is NOT the current admin address (`SelfRotation` guard).
  - [ ] Address format is valid (starts with `G`, 56 chars, checksum passes).
  - [ ] New admin key is generated on a secure, offline device or HSM.
  - [ ] New admin public key has been shared via an **out-of-band verified channel** (e.g. video call, signed PGP message, not just Slack/email).

### 2.2 Operational Readiness

- [ ] **Check cooldown status**: The "Admin" config key has a 6-hour cooldown (`CONFIG_COOLDOWN_SECS = 21_600`). Verify the last admin mutation timestamp is > 6 hours ago, or prepare to wait.
- [ ] **Verify no active proposal**: Run `get_admin_proposal` — must return `None`. If a stale proposal exists, it must be cancelled first.
- [ ] **Confirm network**: RPC URL points to **mainnet** (`https://soroban-rpc.mainnet.stellar.games` or equivalent).
- [ ] **Network passphrase**: `Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015`.
- [ ] **Gas budget**: Ensure the signing account has sufficient XLM for transaction fees.

### 2.3 Communication Plan

- [ ] **Notify stakeholders** (engineering, security, legal) 24 hours before rotation.
- [ ] **Schedule during low-activity window** (avoid billing cycles, batch charges, major releases).
- [ ] **Prepare incident channel**: Dedicated Slack/Discord channel for real-time coordination during the 7-day claim window.
- [ ] **Escalation contact**: Identify who can sign `cancel_admin_proposal` if the current admin becomes unavailable.

### 2.4 Backup & Audit

- [ ] **Export contract snapshot**: Run `export_contract_snapshot` and archive the output.
- [ ] **Document current admin nonce**: Run `get_admin_nonce(current_admin, 1)` and record the value.
- [ ] **Event monitoring**: Ensure indexer/explorer is monitoring for `admin_proposal_created`, `admin_proposal_claimed`, `admin_proposal_cancelled`.

## 3. Step-by-Step Execution

### Step 1: Propose New Admin

**Actor:** Current admin (Admin A)

**Action:** Call `propose_admin` with the verified new admin address.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CONTRACT_ID \
  --source CURRENT_ADMIN_SECRET \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-rpc.mainnet.stellar.games \
  --network-passphrase "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015" \
  -- \
  propose_admin \
  --current_admin $(stellar address from-secret CURRENT_ADMIN_SECRET) \
  --new_admin NEW_ADMIN_ADDRESS
```

**Effects:**
- Instance storage writes an `AdminProposal` record with `proposed_at = now`, `expires_at = now + 604_800` (7 days).
- Emits `admin_proposal_created` event with `old_admin`, `new_admin`, `expires_at`, `timestamp`.
- Rejects if:
  - Caller is not the stored admin → `Unauthorized`
  - `new_admin == contract_address` → `InvalidNewAdmin`
  - A proposal already exists → `ProposalAlreadyExists`

**Verification:**

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CONTRACT_ID \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-rpc.mainnet.stellar.games \
  --network-passphrase "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015" \
  --source SOME_SOURCE \
  -- \
  get_admin_proposal
```

Expected (trimmed):
```json
{
  "new_admin": "GNEWADMIN...",
  "proposed_at": 1753872000,
  "expires_at": 1754476800
}
```

**Security note:** The proposal is stored in **instance storage** (not persistent). It has the same TTL as other instance data and will be cleaned up naturally if the contract instance TTL expires.

---

### Step 2: Verify Proposal (Off-Chain)

**Actor:** Both Admin A and Admin B (independently)

**Actions:**
1. **Confirm `new_admin` address** matches the out-of-band verified public key.
2. **Check `proposed_at` and `expires_at`** are reasonable (should be exactly 7 days apart).
3. **Monitor the `admin_proposal_created` event** on-chain via:
   - Stellar Expert block explorer
   - Custom indexer listening for topic `"admin_proposal_created"`
   - RPC `getEvents` query

**Red flags — cancel immediately if:**
- `new_admin` does not match the agreed address.
- `proposed_at` is in the future or far in the past (indicates clock skew or replay).
- Event was emitted by an unexpected `old_admin` (contract may have been rotated already).

---

### Step 3A: Claim (by New Admin)

**Actor:** New admin (Admin B)

**Window:** Must be called **before `expires_at`**.

**Action:** Call `claim_admin_role`.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CONTRACT_ID \
  --source NEW_ADMIN_SECRET \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-rpc.mainnet.stellar.games \
  --network-passphrase "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015" \
  -- \
  claim_admin_role \
  --claimant $(stellar address from-secret NEW_ADMIN_SECRET)
```

**Effects:**
- `claimant.require_auth()` must pass.
- Proposal is validated: `now <= expires_at` and `claimant == proposal.new_admin`.
- Proposal is **removed** from storage.
- `DataKey::Admin` is **atomically updated** to the claimant.
- Emits `admin_proposal_claimed` event with `old_admin`, `new_admin`, `timestamp`.

**Rejection conditions:**
| Condition | Error | State After |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| No proposal exists | `ProposalNotFound` | Unchanged |
| `now > expires_at` | `ProposalExpired` | Proposal **cleaned up**, admin unchanged |
| `claimant != new_admin` | `InvalidClaimant` | Unchanged |
| `claimant` fails `require_auth()` | Host-level panic | Unchanged |

**Post-Claim Verification:**

```bash
# 1. Confirm admin changed
stellar contract invoke --id CONTRACT_ID --rpc-url ... --source ... -- get_admin
# Expected: NEW_ADMIN_ADDRESS

# 2. Confirm proposal removed
stellar contract invoke --id CONTRACT_ID --rpc-url ... --source ... -- get_admin_proposal
# Expected: None

# 3. Verify new admin can operate
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CONTRACT_ID \
  --source NEW_ADMIN_SECRET \
  --rpc-url ... \
  --network-passphrase ... \
  -- \
  set_min_topup \
  --admin $(stellar address from-secret NEW_ADMIN_SECRET) \
  --min_topup 1000000
```

**Critical:** The old admin **immediately loses** all privileges. There is no grace period.

---

### Step 3B: Cancel (by Current Admin)

**Actor:** Current admin (Admin A)

**When to use:**
- Wrong address was proposed.
- New admin key is suspected compromised before claim.
- Business decision changes before claim.
- Any doubt whatsoever about the proposal.

**Action:** Call `cancel_admin_proposal`.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CONTRACT_ID \
  --source CURRENT_ADMIN_SECRET \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-rpc.mainnet.stellar.games \
  --network-passphrase "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015" \
  -- \
  cancel_admin_proposal \
  --admin $(stellar address from-secret CURRENT_ADMIN_SECRET)
```

**Effects:**
- `admin.require_auth()` must pass and match stored admin.
- Proposal is **removed** from storage.
- Emits `admin_proposal_cancelled` event with `admin`, `timestamp`.
- Admin remains unchanged.
- A new proposal can be created immediately (subject to the 6-hour "Admin" cooldown).

**Rejection conditions:**
| Condition | Error |
|-----------|-------|
| No active proposal | `NoActiveProposal` |
| Caller is not stored admin | `Unauthorized` |

---

### Step 3C: Expiry (Passive)

**Actor:** None — automatic.

If the proposal is neither claimed nor cancelled after 7 days, any subsequent `claim_admin_role` call will:
1. Detect `now > expires_at`.
2. Return `ProposalExpired`.
3. **Clean up the stale proposal** from storage.

No explicit cleanup transaction is required. However, if you want to force cleanup without attempting a claim:

```bash
# Any address can trigger the cleanup by attempting a claim that will fail
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CONTRACT_ID \
  --source ANY_SOURCE \
  --rpc-url ... \
  --network-passphrase ... \
  -- \
  claim_admin_role \
  --claimant ANY_ADDRESS
# Will fail with ProposalExpired and remove the stale proposal
```

---

## 4. Rollback Path

### 4.1 Proposal Exists, Not Yet Claimed

**Path:** `cancel_admin_proposal` → Admin A remains admin → re-propose if needed.

**Timeline:** Immediate. No state change other than proposal removal.

**This is the rollback for "the new admin key is compromised before
acceptance", and it is always available while the proposal is unclaimed.**

The full entrypoint, its error codes and the reasoning are in
[`admin_rotation.md`](../admin_rotation.md) → *Two-Step Rotation and
Rollback*. Operationally:

```bash
# 1. Confirm the proposal is still pending and who it names.
stellar contract invoke --id CONTRACT_ID --rpc-url "$RPC" \
  --network-passphrase "$PASSPHRASE" --source "$ADMIN_A_SECRET" -- \
  get_admin_proposal
# If this returns None there is nothing to cancel — see 4.1.1.

# 2. Cancel. Actor MUST be the current stored admin (Admin A).
stellar contract invoke --id CONTRACT_ID --rpc-url "$RPC" \
  --network-passphrase "$PASSPHRASE" --source "$ADMIN_A_SECRET" -- \
  cancel_admin_proposal \
  --admin $(stellar address from-secret "$ADMIN_A_SECRET")
# Emits: admin_proposal_cancelled
```

**Properties that make this safe mid-incident:**

| Property | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| No 24 h cooldown on cancel | Cancelling is immediate, not deferred. |
| `claim_admin_role` needs a 24 h cooldown after the proposal | Cancelling inside that window means the new admin **provably** cannot have claimed. Race-free. |
| Only the stored admin may cancel | `Unauthorized` otherwise — you cannot cancel someone else's proposal, and cancelling never changes who the stored admin is. |
| Removes one instance-storage key | `DataKey::Admin`, subscriptions, balances, nonces and all other config are untouched. |
| No nonce consumed | A stale `get_admin_nonce` cannot block or be burned by a cancel. |
| Repeatable | `propose_admin` succeeds again immediately after cancelling. |

**Deadline:** the 24 h claim cooldown (`ADMIN_PROPOSAL_COOLDOWN_SECS`), *not*
the 7-day proposal expiry. Once the cooldown has elapsed **and** the new admin
has claimed, there is no rollback — see 4.2.

##### 4.1.1 `get_admin_proposal` returns `None`

The proposal has already been claimed, cancelled, or expired. Determine which
before doing anything else:

- An `admin_proposal_claimed` event in the contract's event history → the new
  admin already holds the role. Go to **4.2**.
- An `admin_proposal_cancelled` event → already rolled back. Nothing to do.
- Neither, and `get_admin_proposal()` is `None` → a `claim_admin_role` that hit
  `ProposalExpired` **removes** the stale proposal as a side effect. Treat as
  expired; re-propose from scratch.

**Do not** respond to a `None` proposal by assuming no rotation happened.
`get_admin()` is the authority on who the stored admin is; `get_admin_proposal`
only reports what is *pending*.

### 4.2 Proposal Was Already Claimed

**Path:** Admin B (now the stored admin) must voluntarily create a new proposal back to Admin A or another trusted address.

**Timeline:** 7-day claim window + however long Admin B takes to act.

**Risk:** If Admin B is uncooperative or keys are lost, there is **no recovery path**. This is why:
- New admin should be a **multisig address** or **governance contract**.
- The old admin should verify Admin B's key custody before proposing.

### 4.3 Both Old and New Admin Keys Lost

**Path:** None. Contract admin is permanently locked.

**Mitigation:**
- Use a **multisig admin** (e.g. 2-of-3 or 3-of-5) so single-key loss is survivable.
- Consider a **governance proposal** (`submit_proposal` with `ProposalKind::RotateAdmin`) as a backup rotation mechanism if the admin is a governance contract.

---

## 5. Edge Cases & Contingencies

### 5.1 Claim Window Elapsed (Unclaimed)

**Scenario:** Admin B does not claim within 7 days.

**Resolution:**
1. Any address can trigger cleanup by calling `claim_admin_role` with any address — it will fail with `ProposalExpired` and remove the stale proposal.
2. Admin A can then create a fresh proposal.

**Prevention:**
- Set calendar reminders at T+5 days and T+6 days.
- Have Admin B confirm readiness to claim within 24 hours of proposal.

### 5.2 Compromised Claimant

**Scenario:** Admin B's private key is compromised **after** proposal but **before** claim.

**Resolution:**
1. Admin A calls `cancel_admin_proposal` immediately.
2. Generate a new secure key pair for Admin B (or choose a different admin).
3. Re-propose with the new address.

**Key insight:** The attacker cannot claim unless they control the **exact proposed address**. They cannot redirect the proposal to their own address.

### 5.3 Repeated Rotations

**Scenario:** Chain of rotations: A → B → C → D.

**Resolution:** Each rotation is independent. After A proposes B and B claims:
- B can immediately propose C (subject to 6-hour cooldown).
- A has no special privileges; they are just a previous admin.

**Test coverage:** `test_two_step_rotation_full_lifecycle` validates A → B → C chains.

### 5.4 Proposal During Emergency Stop

**Scenario:** Contract is in emergency stop mode.

**Resolution:** `propose_admin` is **NOT** gated by emergency stop. Admin rotation is the primary mechanism for handing off control during an incident.

**Post-rotation:** New admin can `disable_emergency_stop` to resume operations.

### 5.5 Old `rotate_admin` Still Exists

**Scenario:** Need to rotate immediately without the 7-day window.

**Resolution:** The legacy `rotate_admin(current_admin, new_admin, nonce)` is still available. It:
- Consumes a nonce for `DOMAIN_ADMIN_ROTATION`.
- Updates admin atomically with no proposal window.
- Is subject to the same `SelfRotation` and `InvalidNewAdmin` guards.
- Is subject to the 6-hour "Admin" cooldown.

**Use only when:**
- Two-step flow is unavailable (e.g. contract upgrade reverted the feature).
- Emergency requires immediate rotation and the signer accepts the irreversibility risk.

## 6. Security Assumptions & Invariants

### 6.1 Threat Model

| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Wrong address proposed | Medium | Critical | 7-day window + cancel path |
| Claimant key compromised | Low | High | Cancel + re-propose |
| Front-running claim | Very Low | Medium | Claimant must match exact address |
| Admin key compromised | Low | Critical | Multisig + cooldown + monitoring |
| Proposal storage DoS | Very Low | Low | Instance storage, cleaned up on expiry |
| Replay of proposal tx | Very Low | Low | No nonce consumed for propose; claim requires auth |

### 6.2 Invariants

1. **Single active proposal:** At most one `AdminProposal` exists in instance storage at any time. `ProposalAlreadyExists` prevents overlap.
2. **Claimant identity:** Only the exact `new_admin` address from the proposal can claim. `InvalidClaimant` rejects all others.
3. **Expiry cleanup:** Expired proposals are removed on the next `claim_admin_role` attempt. No stale proposals persist indefinitely.
4. **Atomic admin swap:** Admin update and proposal removal happen in the same transaction. No intermediate state exists.
5. **No backdoor:** Previous admins have no residual privileges after claim. `Unauthorized` on all admin-protected ops.
6. **Cooldown enforcement:** `enforce_config_cooldown("Admin")` is called on both `propose_admin` and `rotate_admin`, preventing rapid-fire rotations.

### 6.3 Multisig Considerations

- Both `propose_admin` and `claim_admin_role` call `require_auth()` on their respective addresses.
- If the admin is a multisig account, the threshold must be met for each call independently.
- **Recommendation:** Use a **2-of-3 multisig** for production admin to balance security and availability.
