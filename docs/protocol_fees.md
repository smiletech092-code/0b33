# Protocol Fees

The vault supports a protocol fee skim to a configured treasury address on every successful charge.

## Configuration (admin only)

Call `set_protocol_fee(admin, treasury, fee_bps)`:

- `treasury` — address that receives the fee credit (accrued as a merchant balance, withdrawable via `withdraw_merchant_funds`).
- `fee_bps` — fee in basis points, `0..=10_000` (0 = disabled, 10_000 = 100%).

Setting `fee_bps = 0` disables fee collection with no extra code-path branches; the fee computation short-circuits to `(gross, 0)`.

## Accounting invariant

On every successful charge (interval, usage, or one-off):

```
fee        = max(gross * fee_bps / 10_000, 1)   (when fee_bps > 0 and treasury is set)
fee        = 0                                    (when fee_bps = 0 or no treasury)
net        = gross - fee
```

The subscriber's prepaid balance is debited by `gross`. The split is:

| Recipient | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Merchant  | `net`  |
| Treasury  | `fee`  |

**Conservation:** `gross == net + fee` holds on every charge. Rounding truncates toward zero; any remainder (from non-divisible amounts) stays with the merchant.

### Minimum-fee floor

When `fee_bps > 0` and a treasury address is configured, the raw integer division `gross * fee_bps / 10_000` may round to `0` for very small charge amounts (specifically when `gross < 10_000 / fee_bps`). If this happens, the contract enforces a **minimum fee of 1 base unit** rather than allowing the full gross to flow to the merchant. The `gross == net + fee` invariant is preserved because `net = gross - fee(floored)`.

**Example** (fee_bps = 10, i.e. 0.1%):

| gross | raw fee | floored fee | net |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----|
| 1     | 0       | **1**       | 0   |
| 9     | 0       | **1**       | 8   |
| 10    | 0       | **1**       | 9   |
| 100   | 1       | 1           | 99  |
| 10000 | 10      | 10          | 9990|

The floor means a subscription with a very small `amount` will always pay at least 1 base unit of fee per charge when a protocol fee is active. Merchants setting up subscriptions below this threshold should be aware that the effective fee rate may be higher than `fee_bps` basis points for small amounts.

## Fallback: fee_bps > 0 but no treasury

If `fee_bps > 0` but no treasury address is stored (e.g. `set_protocol_fee` was never called), the full gross amount is credited to the merchant and no fee event is emitted. This prevents funds from being silently lost.

## Events

`ProtocolFeeChargedEvent` is emitted on each charge where `fee > 0`:

| Field           | Type      | Description                          |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| `subscription_id` | `u32`   | Subscription that was charged        |
| `merchant`      | `Address` | Merchant receiving the net amount    |
| `token`         | `Address` | Settlement token                     |
| `fee_amount`    | `i128`    | Fee credited to treasury             |
| `treasury`      | `Address` | Treasury address receiving the fee   |
| `timestamp`     | `u64`     | Ledger timestamp                     |

`ProtocolFeeConfiguredEvent` is emitted when `set_protocol_fee` is called.

## Charge types covered

| Charge type | Function              | Fee routing |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Interval    | `charge_one`          | ✓           |
| Usage       | `charge_usage_one`    | ✓           |
| One-off     | `do_charge_one_off`   | ✓           |

## Security notes

- Fee computation uses integer arithmetic with no external calls; no reentrancy risk.
- Treasury balance accrues identically to merchant balances and is subject to the same withdrawal controls.
- `fee_bps > 10_000` is rejected at configuration time (`InvalidInput`).
- The fee is computed from the gross charge amount, not from the merchant's net — preventing fee-on-fee compounding.
- **Minimum-fee floor prevents fee evasion:** when `fee_bps > 0` and a treasury is set, the contract enforces `fee ≥ 1` even if `gross * fee_bps / 10_000` rounds to zero. A charge amount of 1 base unit will always yield a fee of 1 base unit when a protocol fee is active. See the Minimum-fee floor section above for the full table.

## Coupons and Discounts (Issue #474)

Discounts from merchant-managed coupons are applied **before** the protocol fee is calculated. This preserves the strict accounting identity:

```
Gross Charge = Discount + Merchant Net + Treasury Fee
```

The protocol fee is always computed from the **discounted amount** (the payable amount), not the original gross amount.

### Discount Ordering

When a coupon is applied during a charge, discounts are evaluated in this strict order:
1. **Percentage Discount**: `discounted = gross * (10_000 - percent_off_bps) / 10_000`
2. **Fixed Discount**: `discounted = max(discounted - fixed_off, 0)`

The total `discount = gross - discounted`. If the discount exceeds the gross charge, the payable amount is clamped to zero (a $0 charge succeeds, crediting the merchant 0 and extracting a 0 fee).

### Validation at Charge Time

Coupons must match the settlement token of the subscription. At charge time, if a bound coupon has been explicitly revoked by the merchant, or if its `expires_at` timestamp has passed, the discount is **silently skipped** (the charge proceeds at the full gross amount). This intentional design ensures that invalid/lapsed coupons do not cause billing outages for active subscriptions.
