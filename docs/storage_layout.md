# Storage Layout and Upgrade Strategy

This document describes the subscription vault contract's storage layout, keys, and safe upgrade procedures.

---

## Storage Overview

The contract uses Soroban's **instance storage** for global configurations and **persistent storage** for individual, unbounded subscription records. This hybrid strategy prevents instance footprint bloat and eliminates potential key collisions.

### Storage Types

- **Instance Storage**: Global configuration data (Admin, Token, MinTopup, NextId, etc.) uses `env.storage().instance()`.
- **Persistent Storage**: All individual subscription records use `env.storage().persistent()`, keyed under the typed `DataKey::Sub(u32)` enum.
- **Persistence**: Data survives contract upgrades and has appropriate TTL settings for on-chain storage.
- **Access Pattern**: Key-value store with typed keys and values.

---

## Storage Keys and Data Types

### 1. Configuration Keys

| Key | Type | Value Type | Description |
|-----|------|------------|-------------|
| `"token"` | `Symbol` | `Address` | USDC token contract address |
| `"admin"` | `Symbol` | `Address` | Admin address (authorized for batch operations) |
| `"min_topup"` | `Symbol` | `i128` | Minimum deposit amount enforced |
| `"next_id"` | `Symbol` | `u32` | Auto-incrementing subscription ID counter |

**Storage Location**: `contracts/subscription_vault/src/admin.rs` (token, admin, min_topup), `contracts/subscription_vault/src/subscription.rs` (next_id)

**Initialization**: Set once via `init()`, `min_topup` updatable via `set_min_topup()`

---

### 2. Subscription Records

| Key | Type | Value Type | Description |
|-----|------|------------|-------------|
| `DataKey::Sub(id)` | `DataKey` | `Subscription` | Individual subscription data keyed by ID |

**Storage Location**: Persistent keyed storage (`env.storage().persistent()`)

**Subscription Structure** (`contracts/subscription_vault/src/types.rs`):

```rust
pub struct Subscription {
    pub subscriber: Address,           // Subscriber's address
    pub merchant: Address,             // Merchant receiving payments
    pub amount: i128,                  // Payment amount per interval
    pub interval_seconds: u64,         // Billing interval duration
    pub last_payment_timestamp: u64,   // Last successful charge time
    pub status: SubscriptionStatus,    // Current state (Active/Paused/Cancelled/InsufficientBalance)
    pub prepaid_balance: i128,         // Available funds in vault
    pub usage_enabled: bool,           // Usage-based billing flag
}
```

**Status Enum**:
```rust
pub enum SubscriptionStatus {
    Active = 0,
    Paused = 1,
    Cancelled = 2,
    InsufficientBalance = 3,
}
```

**Key Generation**: Sequential u32 IDs from `next_id` counter

**Storage Operations**:
- Create: `do_create_subscription()` → sets `DataKey::Sub(id)` key in persistent storage
- Read: `get_subscription()` → reads `DataKey::Sub(id)` key from persistent storage and extends its TTL when it is near expiration
- Update: All lifecycle functions modify and re-set `DataKey::Sub(id)` key in persistent storage, then extend its TTL via `SUB_TTL_THRESHOLD` / `SUB_TTL_EXTEND_TO`
- Delete: Not implemented (cancelled subscriptions remain in persistent storage)

**TTL behavior:** Subscription entries are kept alive on every read and write. Billing statement secondary index entries and billing period snapshots also carry their own TTL thresholds (`BILLING_STATEMENT_TTL_THRESHOLD`, `BILLING_STATEMENT_TTL_EXTEND_TO`, `BILLING_PERIOD_SNAPSHOT_TTL_THRESHOLD`, `BILLING_PERIOD_SNAPSHOT_TTL_EXTEND_TO`) and are extended when the corresponding storage operations execute.

#### TTL exhaustion semantics

A `DataKey::Sub(id)` entry is readable while `live_until_ledger >= current_ledger`. The contract refreshes this window on every `get_subscription`/`write_subscription` via `extend_ttl(SUB_TTL_THRESHOLD, SUB_TTL_EXTEND_TO)`, so an entry that is touched at least once per `SUB_TTL_EXTEND_TO` window (365 days) never expires.

If the window does lapse, the entry is **archived/expired by the host**, and the next access does **not** degrade gracefully to `Error::NotFound` (which would only surface for a key that was never written). Instead the Soroban host aborts with `Error(Storage, InternalError)`, surfaced to the SDK test harness as a panic. This is the safe outcome: an expired record can never be silently read back as live data. On-chain, accessing it would require a `RestoreFootprint` operation before the read.

This behavior is pinned by `contracts/subscription_vault/tests/ttl_exhaustion.rs`, which forces the env past the TTL boundary and asserts:
- the record is readable at *exactly* its last live ledger;
- one ledger later the access raises the host error (no stale read);
- a read at the last live ledger re-extends the TTL and restores access past the original window;
- a second full TTL cycle preserves the record byte-for-byte, then expires again once unrefreshed.

### 3. Idempotency Ring Buffers

Each subscription has a typed idempotency key, `DataKey::IdemKey(subscription_id)`.
The key is stored in **instance storage** and maps to an `IdemRingBuffer`, not to
the persistent `DataKey::Sub(subscription_id)` record.

```rust
pub struct IdemRingBuffer {
    pub entries: Vec<(BytesN<32>, u64)>,  // (hash, inserted_at_timestamp)
    pub cursor: u32,
}
```

`entries` contains tuples of `(domain-separated SHA-256 fingerprint, ledger timestamp at insertion)`.
The buffer retains at most `IDEM_HISTORY = 64` entries per subscription.
When full, inserting a new fingerprint silently overwrites the oldest slot at `cursor`;
the cursor then advances modulo `IDEM_HISTORY`.

Entries older than `IDEM_TTL_SECS = 7 days` are skipped on lookup and treated as absent,
regardless of ring position. Replay protection is therefore bounded by **both** time and count:
a key is protected for up to 7 days from insertion, or until 64 newer keys have overwritten
its slot — whichever comes first. A missing key (empty buffer or deserialization failure
from a pre-migration on-chain buffer) initializes to an empty buffer on the first insertion.

The hash includes the operation domain, subscription ID, and raw 32-byte key,
so the same raw key used by different entrypoints does not collide. The
idempotency buffer follows the instance-storage lifecycle and is separate from
the subscription record's persistent-storage TTL extension rules.

---

## Known-Instance-Key Allowlist (defensive write guard)

Instance storage holds the contract's global invariant-bearing config (admin,
token, fees, balances, merchant state). A future PR that adds a new `DataKey`
variant — or revives a legacy `Symbol`-keyed code path — could accidentally
write an *unknown* key into instance storage and bypass these invariants. To
catch that drift before it ships, the contract pins a canonical allowlist of the
instance-tier keys.

### Components (`contracts/subscription_vault/src/types.rs`)

| Item | Role |
|------|------|
| `DataKey::canonical_discriminant(&self) -> u32` | Exhaustive, wildcard-free match mapping each variant to its frozen declaration-order discriminant. Adding a variant without an arm is a **compile error**. |
| `KNOWN_INSTANCE_KEY_DISCRIMINANTS: &[u32]` | The canonical, sorted set of instance-tier discriminants (mirrors the registry table). |
| `is_known_instance_discriminant(u32) -> bool` / `DataKey::is_known_instance_key(&self) -> bool` | Membership checks. The raw-`u32` form can reject a *synthetic* unknown key without constructing one. |
| `assert_known_data_key(&DataKey)` | `debug_assert!`-based guard. **No-op in release/wasm** (zero overhead); trips under `cfg(test)`/debug so CI catches drift. |
| `debug_assert_known_key!(key)` | Macro wrapper for instance storage helpers. Expands to nothing in release builds. |

### Two layers of protection

1. **Compile time** — `canonical_discriminant` is exhaustive. A new `DataKey`
   variant cannot compile until it is explicitly numbered, forcing a conscious
   instance-vs-persistent classification.
2. **Test/CI time** — `assert_known_data_key` (via `debug_assert_known_key!`)
   trips if an unknown or persistent-tier key reaches instance storage, while
   remaining a no-op in the deployed wasm.

### Adding a new `DataKey` variant

1. Append the variant to `DataKey` (never reorder existing variants).
2. Append a row to the registry table on `DataKey` with its storage tier.
3. Add a match arm to `canonical_discriminant` with the next number.
4. If it is **instance**-tier, add its discriminant to
   `KNOWN_INSTANCE_KEY_DISCRIMINANTS` and to the positive test enumeration.

The allowlist tests (`types::known_keys_tests`) assert the registry stays
contiguous (`0..=44`), duplicate-free, and exactly consistent with the
classification table, so any of the steps above being skipped fails CI.

## Storage Access Patterns

### Read Operations
- `get_subscription(id)` → Single subscription lookup
- `get_min_topup()` → Config read
- No batch reads or iteration (IDs tracked off-chain)

### Write Operations
- `create_subscription()` → Increments `next_id`, writes new subscription
- `deposit_funds()` → Read-modify-write subscription
- `charge_subscription()` / `batch_charge()` → Read-modify-write subscription(s)
- `pause/resume/cancel_subscription()` → Read-modify-write subscription
- `set_min_topup()` → Config update

### Storage Costs
- Each subscription: ~200 bytes (Address: 32 bytes × 2, i128 × 2, u64 × 2, enum, bool)
- Config keys: ~100 bytes total
- No automatic cleanup (cancelled subscriptions persist)

---

## Versioning and Compatibility

### Current Version
**v1.0** - Initial storage schema (no version field stored)

### Compatibility Guarantees

#### Backward Compatible Changes ✅
- Adding new optional fields to `Subscription` (requires default values)
- Adding new config keys (e.g., `"fee_percentage"`)
- Adding new subscription status variants (append only, preserve existing values)
- Changing function logic without storage schema changes

#### Breaking Changes ❌
- Removing fields from `Subscription`
- Changing field types (e.g., `i128` → `u128`)
- Renaming storage keys
- Reordering enum variants (changes discriminant values)
- Changing key types (e.g., `u32` → `u64` for subscription IDs)

### Schema Version Field (Recommended Future Addition)

To enable safe migrations, add a version key:

```rust
// In init():
env.storage().instance().set(&Symbol::new(env, "schema_version"), &1u32);
```

Check version before operations:
```rust
let version: u32 = env.storage().instance()
    .get(&Symbol::new(env, "schema_version"))
    .unwrap_or(1);
```

## Upgrade Procedures

### Soroban Contract Upgrades

Soroban supports **contract code upgrades** while preserving storage:
1. Deploy new WASM with `soroban contract install`
2. Upgrade instance with `soroban contract upgrade`
3. Storage keys/values remain intact if schema is compatible

### Safe Upgrade Checklist

**Before Upgrade**:
- [ ] Review storage schema changes (use diff on `types.rs`)
- [ ] Verify enum variant order unchanged
- [ ] Test new code against existing storage in testnet
- [ ] Document any new storage keys or fields
- [ ] Plan migration if breaking changes required

**During Upgrade**:
- [ ] Deploy to testnet first
- [ ] Verify existing subscriptions readable with new code
- [ ] Test all state transitions with upgraded contract
- [ ] Monitor for storage-related errors

**After Upgrade**:
- [ ] Verify critical subscriptions still accessible
- [ ] Check config values (token, admin, min_topup)
- [ ] Test charge operations on existing subscriptions

---

## Migration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Additive Changes (Preferred)

Add new fields with defaults, keep old fields:

```rust
pub struct Subscription {
    // ... existing fields ...
    pub new_field: Option<i128>,  // Defaults to None for existing records
}
```

**Pros**: No migration needed, instant upgrade
**Cons**: Storage bloat from unused fields

---

### Strategy 2: Lazy Migration

Migrate records on first access:

```rust
pub fn get_subscription(env: &Env, id: u32) -> Result<Subscription, Error> {
    let mut sub: Subscription = env.storage().instance()
        .get(&id)
        .ok_or(Error::NotFound)?;
    
    // Detect old schema (e.g., missing field)
    if sub.new_field.is_none() {
        sub.new_field = Some(compute_default(&sub));
        env.storage().instance().set(&id, &sub);  // Migrate on read
    }
    Ok(sub)
}
```

**Pros**: Gradual migration, no downtime
**Cons**: Complex logic, inconsistent storage state during transition

---

### Strategy 3: Batch Migration

Separate migration contract or admin function:

```rust
pub fn migrate_subscriptions(env: Env, ids: Vec<u32>) -> Result<(), Error> {
    let admin = require_admin(&env)?;
    admin.require_auth();
    
    for id in ids.iter() {
        let old_sub: OldSubscription = env.storage().instance().get(&id)?;
        let new_sub = Subscription::from_old(old_sub);
        env.storage().instance().set(&id, &new_sub);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

**Pros**: Clean separation, controlled migration
**Cons**: Requires off-chain ID tracking, multiple transactions

---

## Potential Pitfalls

### 1. Enum Discriminant Changes
**Problem**: Adding variants in the middle changes discriminant values
```rust
// Before upgrade
pub enum SubscriptionStatus {
    Active = 0,
    Paused = 1,
    Cancelled = 2,
}

// WRONG: Inserts new variant
pub enum SubscriptionStatus {
    Active = 0,
    Pending = 1,  // ❌ Shifts all subsequent values
    Paused = 2,   // Was 1, now 2 - breaks existing storage!
    Cancelled = 3,
}

// CORRECT: Append only
pub enum SubscriptionStatus {
    Active = 0,
    Paused = 1,
    Cancelled = 2,
    Pending = 3,  // ✅ New variant at end
}
```

### 2. Key Collision
**Problem**: New keys conflict with subscription IDs.
With our storage architecture:
- Subscription records live in persistent storage (`env.storage().persistent()`) keyed under `DataKey::Sub(u32)`.
- Global configurations live in instance storage (`env.storage().instance()`) keyed under `Symbol`s or other typed keys.
Because persistent and instance storages occupy completely disjoint namespaces in Soroban, key collision between configurations and subscriptions is physically impossible. However, when adding new config keys in instance storage, always use unique `DataKey` variants or `Symbol`s to prevent internal collisions.

```rust
// Subscription (Persistent Storage)
env.storage().persistent().set(&DataKey::Sub(0), &sub);

// Config (Instance Storage)
env.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::NextId, &1u32);
```

### 3. Missing Default Values
**Problem**: New required fields break deserialization
```rust
// Before
pub struct Subscription {
    pub amount: i128,
}

// After - BREAKS existing storage
pub struct Subscription {
    pub amount: i128,
    pub fee: i128,  // ❌ No default, deserialization fails
}

// Fix: Use Option or provide migration
pub struct Subscription {
    pub amount: i128,
    pub fee: Option<i128>,  // ✅ Defaults to None
}
```

### 4. ID Counter Overflow
**Problem**: `next_id` (u32) can overflow after 4B subscriptions
```rust
// Current implementation (subscription.rs:8)
let id: u32 = env.storage().instance().get(&key).unwrap_or(0);
env.storage().instance().set(&key, &(id + 1));  // ❌ Panics on overflow

// Better: Check for overflow
let id: u32 = env.storage().instance().get(&key).unwrap_or(0);
let next = id.checked_add(1).ok_or(Error::Overflow)?;
env.storage().instance().set(&key, &next);
```

### 5. Storage Bloat
**Problem**: Cancelled subscriptions never deleted
- **Impact**: Unbounded storage growth
- **Mitigation**: Implement archive/cleanup mechanism or off-chain indexing

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Add schema version field** in next upgrade
2. **Add overflow check** to `next_id()` counter
3. **Document enum variant order** as immutable in code comments

### Future Enhancements
1. **Storage cleanup**: Add admin function to archive old subscriptions
2. **Batch reads**: Add `get_subscriptions(Vec<u32>)` for efficiency
3. **Storage metrics**: Track total subscriptions, active count
4. **Migration hooks**: Add `on_upgrade()` entrypoint for automated migrations

### Testing Upgrades
1. Create testnet contract with sample data
2. Deploy upgraded WASM to separate instance
3. Copy storage snapshot to upgraded instance (if tooling available)
4. Verify all operations work with old data
5. Only then upgrade mainnet

## Summary

**Storage Model**: Instance storage with Symbol keys (config) and u32 keys (subscriptions)

**Upgrade Safety**: Additive changes safe, breaking changes require migration

**Key Risks**: Enum reordering, key collisions, missing defaults, ID overflow

**Best Practice**: Always test upgrades on testnet with production-like data before mainnet deployment
