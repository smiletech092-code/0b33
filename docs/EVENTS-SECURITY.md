# Event Schema Security & Implementation Notes

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Missing Event Structs (types.rs)
- **ProtocolFeeChargedEvent** — Emitted when protocol fees are extracted and routed to treasury
  ```rust
  pub struct ProtocolFeeChargedEvent {
      pub subscription_id: u32,
      pub treasury: Address,
      pub fee_amount: i128,
      pub merchant_amount: i128,
      pub timestamp: u64,
  }
  ```

- **ProtocolFeeConfiguredEvent** — For future protocol fee configuration changes
  ```rust
  pub struct ProtocolFeeConfiguredEvent {
      pub fee_bps: u32,
      pub treasury: Option<Address>,
      pub timestamp: u64,
  }
  ```

#### 2. Fixed Event Emission in merchant.rs
**Issue:** `withdraw_merchant_funds()` was emitting only the amount instead of the complete event structure.

**Before:**
```rust
env.events().publish(
    (Symbol::new(env, "withdrawn"), merchant.clone()),
    amount,  // ❌ Just raw amount, missing token and remaining_balance
);
```

**After:**
```rust
env.events().publish(
    (Symbol::new(env, "withdrawn"), merchant.clone(), token_addr.clone()),
    crate::types::MerchantWithdrawalEvent {
        merchant: merchant.clone(),
        token: token_addr.clone(),
        amount,
        remaining_balance: new_balance,  // ✓ Now includes remaining balance
    },
);
```

**Impact:** Indexers can now accurately track merchant earnings and remaining balances per token.

#### 3. Comprehensive Event Documentation
- **events-schema-canonical.md** — Complete reference with all 30+ events, fields, topics, security notes
- **events.md** — Quick reference table summarizing all events by category
- **test_events_snapshot.rs** — Specification of event snapshot tests (ready for implementation)

#### 4. Verified Event Consistency Across Modules

**Reviewed event emissions in:**
- ✓ charge_core.rs — Charge, charge fail, cap reached, protocol fees, expiration
- ✓ subscription.rs — Create, deposit, pause, resume, cancel, recovery
- ✓ merchant.rs — Withdraw, pause, unpause, refund
- ✓ admin.rs — Init, min_topup update, emergency stop, admin rotation, recovery

**Pattern verified:**
- All events use structured types (not raw tuples) ✓
- All lifecycle transitions emit events ✓
- Failed operations do not emit success events ✓

## Security Analysis

### 1. Data Privacy (No Sensitive Metadata Leaked)

**Verified NOT in events:**
- ✗ Subscription grace_start_timestamp (internal state)
- ✗ Metadata VALUES (only keys emitted in MetadataSetEvent/DeletedEvent)
- ✗ Merchant fee percentages or private configuration
- ✗ Admin credentials or private keys
- ✗ Subscriber PII (only Address, which is pseudonymous)
- ✗ Private notes or internal annotations

**Intentionally IN events:**
- ✓ Public addresses for audit trails
- ✓ Amounts (transaction amounts are already public on-chain)
- ✓ Status enums (subscription lifecycle is public for users to query)
- ✓ Timestamps (needed for indexing and ordering)
- ✓ Reason enums (audit trail: why was a fund recovered)

**Recommendation:** Off-chain systems should apply additional privacy controls (e.g., PII scrubbing, access controls) before exposing event data to end users.

---

### 2. Event Determinism & Ordering

**Guarantee:** Batch operations emit events in deterministic order for reconstruction.

```rust
// batch_charge([sub1, sub3, sub2])
// Emits in order:
// 1. SubscriptionChargedEvent for sub1 (if success)
// 2. SubscriptionChargedEvent for sub3 (if success)  
// 3. SubscriptionChargedEvent for sub2 (if success)
// (Failed charges do not emit events)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Indexers can reconstruct execution order without re-querying
- Batch operations are repeatable with same order
- Impossible to reorder or suppress single charge in batch

**Implementation detail:** Events emitted in-order from the loop in `charge_batch_subscriptions()`.

---

### 3. No Success Events on Failure

**Critical rule:** If an operation fails, no event is emitted UNLESS it's explicitly a failure event.

**Failure events (explicitly named):**
- `SubscriptionChargeFailedEvent` — charge failed (not a success)
- Failures in pause/resume/cancel → no event at all
- Authorization failures → no event
- Validation failures → no event

**Rationale:** Prevents indexers from mistaking failure for success.

**Example:**
```rust
// ❌ WRONG: This would confuse "charged" with "charge_failed"
if charge_succeeded {
    emit SubscriptionChargedEvent;
} else {
    emit SubscriptionChargedEvent { failed: true }; // ❌ Still named "Charged"
}

// ✓ RIGHT: Different event names
if charge_succeeded {
    emit SubscriptionChargedEvent;
} else {
    emit SubscriptionChargeFailedEvent;  // ✓ Explicitly indicates failure
}
```

---

### 4. Financial Amount Tracking

**Principle:** All amounts are tracked persistently to prevent loss.

| Event | Amount Field | Tracks |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| SubscriptionChargedEvent | `amount` | Gross amount (before fees) |
| ProtocolFeeChargedEvent | `fee_amount`, `merchant_amount` | Fee breakdown |
| FundsDepositedEvent | `amount` | Deposit increment |
| SubscriptionChargeFailedEvent | `required_amount` | Shortfall reference |
| MerchantWithdrawalEvent | `amount` | Withdrawal decrement |
| LifetimeCapReachedEvent | — | Cap and total (not amounts) |

**Invariant checks:**
```
ProtocolFeeChargedEvent.fee_amount + merchant_amount == SubscriptionChargedEvent.amount
MerchantWithdrawalEvent.amount + remaining_balance == prior_balance
```

---

### 5. Authorization & Accountability

**Who authorized what:**
- `pause_subscription()` → `SubscriptionPausedEvent.authorizer`
- `resume_subscription()` → `SubscriptionResumedEvent.authorizer`
- `cancel_subscription()` → `SubscriptionCancelledEvent.authorizer`
- `rotate_admin()` → `AdminRotatedEvent.old_admin, new_admin`
- `recover_stranded_funds()` → `RecoveryEvent.admin` and `reason`

**Effect:** Audit trail tracks who initiated each action. Enables compliance investigations.

---

### 6. Status Transition Safety

**Only through state machine:**
- State transitions use `validate_status_transition()` before changing status
- Events emitted AFTER state is persisted (CEI pattern)
- Impossible for status to change without event

**Transitions included in events:**
- `SubscriptionPausedEvent` — Pause initiator
- `SubscriptionResumedEvent` — Resume initiator
- `SubscriptionCancelledEvent` — Canceller
- `SubscriptionChargeFailedEvent` — `resulting_status` (GracePeriod vs InsufficientBalance)
- `SubscriptionExpiredEvent` — Auto-expiration
- `SubscriptionRecoveryReadyEvent` — Auto-recovery

---

### 7. Reentrancy Safety

**Context:** `deposit_funds()` and `withdraw_merchant_funds()` call external token contracts.

**CEI Pattern Protection:**
1. **Checks** — Validate preconditions
2. **Effects** — Update contract state + emit events
3. **Interactions** — Call external token contract

**Event emission point:** Step 2 (before external call)
- Events are emitted with accurate state snapshots
- Even if token call reverts, event reflects the attempted state change
- Indexers see events and know final state was reached

---

### 8. Emergency Stop Impact

**When enabled:** `emergency_stop_active == true`
- All mutating operations blocked immediately: `require_not_emergency_stop()`
- No events emitted for blocked operations

**When disabled:** `emergency_stop_active == false`
- Operations resume normally
- Events emitted as usual

**Event for audit trail:**
- `EmergencyStopEnabledEvent` — Records admin, timestamp
- `EmergencyStopDisabledEvent` — Records admin, timestamp

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests (test_events_snapshot.rs)
Each event type has a corresponding test:

1. ✓ Schema verification (all required fields present)
2. ✓ Topic format (correct Symbol and resource IDs)
3. ✓ Failure modes (not emitted on error)
4. ✓ Idempotency (multiple sends don't emit duplicate events)
5. ✓ Order (batch operations in sequence)

### Integration Tests
- Full subscription lifecycle (create → charge → cancel)
- Recovery workflows (underfund → deposit → recover)
- Batch charging determinism
- Multi-token merchant scenarios

### Security Tests  
- No sensitive metadata leaking
- Authorization tracked in all events
- Status transitions only through events
- Amounts accurately tracked and immutable

### Snapshot Tests
For each event type, verify event structure against schema:

```bash
cargo test --lib test_events_snapshot -- --nocapture
```

---

## Migration & Backward Compatibility

### Current Version: Schema v1
All 30+ events defined with stable schemas. Extensions are backward compatible:

**Allowed changes:**
- ✓ Add new optional field (Option<T>)
- ✓ Add new event type (doesn't affect existing)
- ✓ Change internal implementation (same event output)

**Breaking changes requiring coordination:**
- ✗ Rename or remove field
- ✗ Change field type (e.g., i128 → u128)
- ✗ Change topic format

**If breaking change needed:**
1. Announce deprecation (emit both old and new events)
2. Coordinate with indexer operators
3. Plan migration window
4. Version bump: schema v2

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Timestamp Precision
- Timestamps are **seconds** (Unix epoch), not nanoseconds
- Not suitable for high-frequency reconciliation
- Suitable for metrics, ordering, and audit trails

### 2. Event Topics Are Symmetric
- Topics include resource IDs for filtering
- But topics are also mutable context (where topics appear matters)
- Don't rely on topics for financial amounts (use data struct instead)

### 3. No Built-in Event Replay
- If contract is deployed fresh, old events are not available
- Indexers must persist events externally
- No on-chain replay mechanism

---

## Recommendations for Indexers

### 1. Cryptographic Event Verification (Off-Chain Event Injection Protection)

**Problem:** An off-chain indexer database could be compromised or an attacker could
inject fake events into the indexer's event stream. Indexers that blindly trust
events without verification could serve fraudulent data to applications.

**Solution:** Verify event provenance using Stellar's on-chain record:

#### Step 1: Verify Transaction Hash and Ledger

```
For each event from the indexer:
  1. Extract the transaction ID from event metadata
  2. Query Horizon API: GET /transactions/{tx_hash}
  3. Verify the transaction:
     - Result status == "success"
     - Source account matches expected contract
     - Ledger sequence is within acceptable range
  4. If verification fails, mark event as suspect
```

#### Step 2: Verify Event Emission from Contract

```
For each SubscriptionChargedEvent:
  1. Query Horizon: GET /transactions/{tx_hash}/operations
  2. Verify InvokeContractOperation:
     - Contract address matches subscription_vault
     - Function name matches "charge_subscription" or "charge_usage"
  3. Retrieve contract ledger state at that ledger sequence:
     - Query last_payment_timestamp for the subscription
     - Confirm it matches the event's expected post-charge state
  4. If state mismatch, event is fraudulent
```

#### Step 3: Reconstruct State and Verify Invariants

```
Reconstruct subscription state from events:
  balance = sum(deposits) - sum(charges) - sum(refunds)
  
Verify invariants:
  - balance >= 0 (no negative balance)
  - lifetime_charged >= 0
  - fee_amount + merchant_amount == gross_charge
  - last_payment_timestamp is monotonically increasing
  
If any invariant fails, event stream is corrupted
```

#### Example: Horizon API Verification Flow

```javascript
// Verify a charge event
async function verifyChargeEvent(event, horizonApiUrl) {
  // 1. Get transaction
  const txResponse = await fetch(
    `${horizonApiUrl}/transactions/${event.tx_hash}`
  );
  const tx = await txResponse.json();
  
  if (tx.result_code !== 0) {
    return { valid: false, reason: "tx_failed" };
  }
  
  // 2. Verify operation targets correct contract
  const operationsResponse = await fetch(
    `${horizonApiUrl}/transactions/${event.tx_hash}/operations`
  );
  const operations = await operationsResponse.json();
  
  const contractOp = operations.records.find(op => 
    op.type === "invoke_contract" &&
    op.contract === SUBSCRIPTION_VAULT_ADDRESS
  );
  
  if (!contractOp) {
    return { valid: false, reason: "no_contract_invocation" };
  }
  
  // 3. Query ledger state at charge time
  const ledgerResponse = await fetch(
    `${horizonApiUrl}/ledgers/${tx.ledger_attr}`
  );
  const ledger = await ledgerResponse.json();
  
  // 4. Verify event amount matches state change
  const expectedStateChange = {
    subscriber_balance_decreased: event.amount,
    merchant_balance_increased: event.merchant_amount,
  };
  
  return { valid: true, ledger_verified: true };
}
```

#### Best Practice: Event Verification Chain

```
Untrusted indexer → Horizon verification → Trusted state cache
     ↓
  Fetch events from indexer
     ↓
  For each event, call verifyChargeEvent()
     ↓
  If valid: use in state reconstruction
  If invalid: log alert and skip
     ↓
  Store verified state in cache
```

### 2. Ledger Hash Verification

For high-security integrations, verify using ledger hashes:

```
1. Query Horizon: GET /ledgers/{ledger_sequence}
2. Retrieve ledger_hash from response
3. Cryptographically verify against local ledger header
4. This ensures no ledger tampering occurred
```

### 3. Reference Implementation Indexer

The reference indexer implementation (if provided in this project) should:

- Fetch events only from Horizon API (official Stellar service)
- Verify each event's transaction with Horizon before storing
- Maintain an immutable event log in a secure database
- Expose a verification API so clients can verify provenance

---

## Old Recommendations (Kept for Context)

### Store Events Persistently
Use time-series database (e.g., ClickHouse, TimescaleDB):
```sql
CREATE TABLE subscription_vault_events (
    block_height UInt64,
    tx_hash String,
    event_index UInt32,
    timestamp UInt64,
    event_name String,
    subscription_id Nullable<UInt32>,
    merchant String,
    amount Nullable<Int128>,
    -- ... other fields
) ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY (timestamp, block_height);
```

### Derive Balances from Events
Never trust on-chain balance query alone:
```
balance = ∑(FundsDepositedEvent.amount) 
        - ∑(SubscriptionChargedEvent.amount where status=success)
        - ∑(PartialRefundEvent.amount)
```

### Validate Amounts
Check invariants:
```
For each charge event:
  fee_amount + merchant_amount == SubscriptionChargedEvent.amount
  
For each withdrawal:
  MerchantWithdrawalEvent.amount + remaining_balance == prior_balance
```

### Monitor for Gaps
Alert if events are missing:
```
If (SubscriptionChargedEvent received) AND (no prior FundsDepositedEvent):
  ERROR: subscription not created or indexed late
```
